## Thanks
A special "Thank you" to the [Spark Team](http://spark.io) for open-sourcing their [Spark App](https://github.com/spark/android-app/).
Since our Senior Design project is built with their product at the "Core", we truly could not have done it without them.
An additional "Thank you" is deserved by our project advisor, [Scott Norr](http://www.d.umn.edu/~snorr). He's worked through this project with us from the very beginning, and has given us lots of great ideas to look into.
